<p>On this blog, I share cute insights and little nuggets of wisdom that I stumble
upon in my work as a data scientist. I have a pretty solid background in
mathematics and such, but my knowledge and education on the topic of statistics
and machine learning has been much less structured. I learn by collecting these
little insights and I though it'd be nice to share some of them with you.</p>
